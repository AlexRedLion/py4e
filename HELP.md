Looking for Help
================

I am looking for help with the Spanish translation of the book
because I have a tight timeine for the delivery of the Spanish
version of the book.

In particular, I need translators that:

* Knows Markdown
* Knows Python
* Knows github
* Can use OmniGraffle

It would be great if the translator had access to a Mac laptop
or Linux to re-generate the book but that is not essential.

I would be interested in hearing from professional translators
that could work quickly on the book to help meet out tight timeline.
