Welcome to the Spanish Translation of www.py4e.com
==================================================

This is the spanish version of www.py4e.com available at
at es.py4e.com.

You can help with the Spanish translation if you have a github
account.  You can use the github editor to send up "pull requests"
whcih we will review and apply.

You can also become a core committer for the project to help review
and apply changes to the site as well as apply your own translations
directly.  The best way to become a core contributor is to start
doing some work and after a while, it will just be simpler to make you
a core contributor.

We can do most of our communication through github issues and pull requests
but if you need to, please contact Dr. Chuck via email.

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Important Translation Areas
---------------------------

* The book chapters under the folder `book3` - the book is written in
Markdown so it is prety easy to edit the book using any text editor.
Look for the files that end in '.mkd' and edit the files.  Much of the code
samples for the book are in the `code3` folder and are merged into the
book as part of the book production process.  Some of code samples
that don't work without special configuration are included
directly in the book.

* The code samples under the folder `code3` - make sure to syntax check
your code after you make the changes.  These code snippets are included
into the text of the book as part of the book production process.

* The OmniGraffle figures under `figures` - these are manually exported
into the EPS and SVG formats under images fo inclusion in the EPUB, HMTL,
and PDF versions of the book.  You will need the OmniGraffle software
to edit these figures.

* The text of the web site in the various `.php` files in the repository.
It will help to know PHP to know what to translate without breaking 
the files.
